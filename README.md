# PlantieGuard

---

**PlantieGuard** is a tool that allows you to better take care of your plants at home, simply by using your smartphone.

### How does it do this?

The device, placed in the soil of your plant's pot, will measure atmospherical data from the ambient and the soil, and will transmit this data directly to your smartphone.
The device holds a small tank of water, and therefore allows you to water your plant simply by using your phone, at the press of a button.
Just in case you happen to forget, the device automatically waters the soil to keep your plantie well and healthy.

A detailed history of the plant's progress is kept in the memory of the application, so that from your phone you can see the intervals at which the plant has been watered, and the progress of the ambiental parameters.

Especially if your plant is water-dependant or you're away from home for a longer period of time, **PlantieGuard** can save you a lot of troubles!

### What did the idea start from?

I have many plants in my home, but I also happen to leave for longer periods of time rather often. Therefore, I always need someone to come in and water my plants once in a while, and it's not pleasant to always have to ask people to do this. This is what made me think of a device that could solve this problem, allowing me to take care of my plants from far away, or allowing it to take care of my plants by itself.

### Why do I think it's useful?

I think many people are in the situation that they simply forget to water their plants, because life is full and stressful and when something doesn't come up to your face to tell you what it needs, it's easy to forget. As we're connected more and more to our mobile devices, having push notifications to tell us that our plants are in trouble is something that for sure helps as a reminder.
